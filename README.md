# Automated Data Collection - Data Entry Robot Project

## Overview

The Data Entry Robot project aims to automate the process of data entry using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology. This project involves designing and developing an RPA robot that can extract data from spreadsheets and enter it into target systems or databases. The robot will be programmed to perform tasks such as data validation, data cleansing, and data transformation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data.

## Features

- **Data Extraction:** Extract data from various formats, primarily spreadsheets.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure the data meets predefined criteria before entry.
- **Data Cleansing:** Remove or correct any inaccuracies in the data.
- **Data Transformation:** Modify data as required to fit the target system's format.
- **Data Entry:** Automatically input the processed data into target systems or databases.
- **Efficiency & Accuracy:** Significantly reduce errors and increase efficiency compared to manual data entry.
- **Resource Optimization:** Free up human resources to focus on higher-level tasks, such as data analysis and decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **RPA Software:** UiPath
- **Programming Languages:** VB.NET, C#, or Python (as supported by UiPath)
- **Data Sources:** Spreadsheets (Excel), Databases (SQL, NoSQL)

## Installation and Setup
